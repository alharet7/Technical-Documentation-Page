            <p>C# (pronounced "See Sharp") is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. C# enables
                developers to build many types of secure and robust applications that run in .NET. C# has its roots in
                the C
                family of languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript programmers. This
                tour
                provides an overview of the major components of the language in C# 11 and earlier. If you want to
                explore
                the language through interactive examples, try the introduction to C# tutorials.</p>
            <p>C# is an object-oriented, component-oriented programming language. C# provides language constructs to
                directly support these concepts, making C# a natural language in which to create and use software
                components. Since its origin, C# has added features to support new workloads and emerging software
                design
                practices. At its core, C# is an object-oriented language. You define types and their behavior.</p>
            <p>Several C# features help create robust and durable applications. Garbage collection automatically
                reclaims
                memory occupied by unreachable unused objects. Nullable types guard against variables that don't refer
                to
                allocated objects. Exception handling provides a structured and extensible approach to error detection
                and
                recovery. Lambda expressions support functional programming techniques. Language Integrated Query (LINQ)
                syntax creates a common pattern for working with data from any source. Language support for asynchronous
                operations provides syntax for building distributed systems. C# has a unified type system. All C# types,
                including primitive types such as int and double, inherit from a single root object type. All types
                share a
                set of common operations. Values of any type can be stored, transported, and operated upon in a
                consistent
                manner. Furthermore, C# supports both user-defined reference types and value types. C# allows dynamic
                allocation of objects and in-line storage of lightweight structures. C# supports generic methods and
                types,
                which provide increased type safety and performance. C# provides iterators, which enable implementers of
                collection classes to define custom behaviors for client code.</p>
            <p>C# emphasizes versioning to ensure programs and libraries can evolve over time in a compatible manner.
                Aspects of C#'s design that were directly influenced by versioning considerations include the separate
                virtual and override modifiers, the rules for method overload resolution, and support for explicit
                interface
                member declarations.</p>

            <header>.NET architecture</header>
            <p>C# programs run on .NET, a virtual execution system called the common language runtime (CLR) and a set of
                class libraries. The CLR is the implementation by Microsoft of the common language infrastructure (CLI),
                an
                international standard. The CLI is the basis for creating execution and development environments in
                which
                languages and libraries work together seamlessly.</p>
            <p>Source code written in C# is compiled into an intermediate language (IL) that conforms to the CLI
                specification. The IL code and resources, such as bitmaps and strings, are stored in an assembly,
                typically
                with an extension of .dll. An assembly contains a manifest that provides information about the
                assembly's
                types, version, and culture.</p>
            <p>When the C# program is executed, the assembly is loaded into the CLR. The CLR performs Just-In-Time (JIT)
                compilation to convert the IL code to native machine instructions. The CLR provides other services
                related
                to automatic garbage collection, exception handling, and resource management. Code that's executed by
                the
                CLR is sometimes referred to as "managed code." "Unmanaged code," is compiled into native machine
                language
                that targets a specific platform.</p>
            <p>Language interoperability is a key feature of .NET. IL code produced by the C# compiler conforms to the
                Common Type Specification (CTS). IL code generated from C# can interact with code that was generated
                from
                the .NET versions of F#, Visual Basic, C++. There are more than 20 other CTS-compliant languages. A
                single
                assembly may contain multiple modules written in different .NET languages. The types can reference each
                other as if they were written in the same language.</p>
            <p>In addition to the runtime services, .NET also includes extensive libraries. These libraries support many
                different workloads. They're organized into namespaces that provide a wide variety of useful
                functionality.
                The libraries include everything from file input and output to string manipulation to XML parsing, to
                web
                application frameworks to Windows Forms controls. The typical C# application uses the .NET class library
                extensively to handle common "plumbing" chores.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
            <header>Hello world</header>
            <p>The "Hello, World" program is traditionally used to introduce a programming language. Here it is in C#:
            </p>
            <pre class="codeContainer1" id="codeContainer1"><code>using System;

            class Hello
            {
                static void Main()
                {
                    // This line prints "Hello, World" 
                    Console.WriteLine("Hello, World");
                }
            }</code></pre>
            <p>The "Hello, World" program starts with a using directive that references the System namespace. Namespaces
                provide a hierarchical means of organizing C# programs and libraries. Namespaces contain types and other
                namespacesâ€”for example, the System namespace contains a number of types, such as the Console class
                referenced in the program, and many other namespaces, such as IO and Collections. A using directive that
                references a given namespace enables unqualified use of the types that are members of that namespace.
                Because of the using directive, the program can use Console.WriteLine as shorthand for
                System.Console.WriteLine.</p>
            <p>The Hello class declared by the "Hello, World" program has a single member, the method named Main. The
                Main
                method is declared with the static modifier. While instance methods can reference a particular enclosing
                object instance using the keyword this, static methods operate without reference to a particular object.
                By
                convention, a static method named Main serves as the entry point of a C# program.</p>
            <p>The line starting with // is a single line comment. C# single line comments start with // continue to the
                end
                of the current line. C# also supports multi-line comments. Multi-line comments start with /* and end
                with
                */. The output of the program is produced by the WriteLine method of the Console class in the System
                namespace. This class is provided by the standard class libraries, which, by default, are automatically
                referenced by the compiler.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Types_and_variables">
            <header>Types and variables</header>
            <p>A type defines the structure and behavior of any data in C#. The declaration of a type may include its
                members, base type, interfaces it implements, and operations permitted for that type. A variable is a
                label
                that refers to an instance of a specific type.</p>
            <p>There are two kinds of types in C#: value types and reference types. Variables of value types directly
                contain their data. Variables of reference types store references to their data, the latter being known
                as
                objects. With reference types, it's possible for two variables to reference the same object and possible
                for
                operations on one variable to affect the object referenced by the other variable. With value types, the
                variables each have their own copy of the data, and it isn't possible for operations on one to affect
                the
                other (except for ref and out parameter variables).</p>
            <p>An identifier is a variable name. An identifier is a sequence of unicode characters without any
                whitespace.
                An identifier may be a C# reserved word, if it's prefixed by @. Using a reserved word as an identifier
                can
                be useful when interacting with other languages.</p>
            <p>C#'s value types are further divided into simple types, enum types, struct types, nullable value types,
                and
                tuple value types. C#'s reference types are further divided into class types, interface types, array
                types,
                and delegate types.</p>

                        Every enum type has an underlying type, which must be one of the eight integral types. The set
                        of
                        values of an enum type is the same as the set of values of the underlying type.</li>

            <p>The key organizational concepts in C# are programs, namespaces, types, members, and assemblies. Programs
                declare types, which contain members and can be organized into namespaces. Classes, structs, and
                interfaces
                are examples of types. Fields, methods, properties, and events are examples of members. When C# programs
                are
                compiled, they're physically packaged into assemblies. Assemblies typically have the file extension .exe
                or
                .dll, depending on whether they implement applications or libraries, respectively.</p>
            <p>As a small example, consider an assembly that contains the following code:</p>
            <pre class="codeContainer2" id="codeContainer2"><code>namespace Acme.Collections;

            public class Stack<T>
            {
                Entry _top;
            
                public void Push(T data)
                {
                    _top = new Entry(_top, data);
                }
            
                public T Pop()
                {
                    if (_top == null)
                    {
                        throw new InvalidOperationException();
                    }
                    T result = _top.Data;
                    _top = _top.Next;
            
                    return result;
                }
            
                class Entry
                {
                    public Entry Next { get; set; }
                    public T Data { get; set; }
            
                    public Entry(Entry next, T data)
                    {
                        Next = next;
                        Data = data;
                    }
                }
            }</code></pre>
            <p>The fully qualified name of this class is Acme.Collections.Stack. The class contains several members: a
                field
                named _top, two methods named Push and Pop, and a nested class named Entry. The Entry class further
                contains
                three members: a property named Next, a property named Data, and a constructor. The Stack is a generic
                class. It has one type parameter, T that is replaced with a concrete type when it's used.</p>
            <p>A stack is a "first in - last out" (FILO) collection. New elements are added to the top of the stack.
                When an
                element is removed, it's removed from the top of the stack. The previous example declares the Stack type
                that defines the storage and behavior for a stack. You can declare a variable that refers to an instance
                of
                the Stack type to use that functionality.</p>
            <p>Assemblies contain executable code in the form of Intermediate Language (IL) instructions, and symbolic
                information in the form of metadata. Before it's executed, the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler of .NET
                Common
                Language Runtime converts the IL code in an assembly to processor-specific code.</p>
            <p>Because an assembly is a self-describing unit of functionality containing both code and metadata, there's
                no
                need for #include directives and header files in C#. The public types and members contained in a
                particular
                assembly are made available in a C# program simply by referencing that assembly when compiling the
                program.
                For example, this program uses the Acme.Collections.Stack class from the acme.dll assembly:</p>
            <pre class="codeContainer3" id="codeContainer3"><code>class Example
            {
                public static void Main()
                {
                    var s = new Acme.Collections.Stack<int>();
                    s.Push(1); // stack contains 1
                    s.Push(10); // stack contains 1, 10
                    s.Push(100); // stack contains 1, 10, 100

            <p>To compile this program, you would need to reference the assembly containing the stack class defined in
                the
                earlier example.</p>
            <p>C# programs can be stored in several source files. When a C# program is compiled, all of the source files
                are
                processed together, and the source files can freely reference each other. Conceptually, it's as if all
                the
                source files were concatenated into one large file before being processed. Forward declarations are
                never
                needed in C# because, with few exceptions, declaration order is insignificant. C# doesn't limit a source
                file to declaring only one public type nor does it require the name of the source file to match a type
                declared in the source file.</p>
